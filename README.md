# REPORT
Released code of our ICASSP'23 oral paper: [Inductive Relation Prediction from Relational Paths and Context with Hierarchical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00215)

## Requirements
In short, we use ```networkx==2.7``` and ```pandas==1.4.1``` for data preprocessing, and use ```pytorch=1.10.0``` to run the experiments. You can set the environment accordingly, or use the same environment as ours by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
